#iFireTracker Business Requirements
 
## Overview
The iFireTracker project aims to develop a data product that can identify high-fire risk areas in Christchurch, New Zealand, and generate a list of locations where early fire detection sensors should be installed. These sensors will be monitored by the city council, enabling prompt response to potential fire incidents.

## Goals
1. Use satellite and other relevant data sources to analyse and predict fire risk in Christchurch.
2. Develop a machine learning model or analytical approach to identify high-risk areas based on the data analysis.
3. Generate a prioritised list of locations where early fire detection sensors should be installed.
4. Provide a user-friendly interface or output document for the city council to visualise the identified high-risk areas and sensor locations.

## Key Requirements
1. Data Integration: Ability to ingest and process various data sources, for example: satellite imagery, weather data, vegetation information, and historical fire records.
2. Data Analysis and Modeling: Implement suitable machine learning algorithms or analytical techniques to analyse the data and identify patterns or factors that contribute to fire risk.
3. Risk Assessment: Develop a methodology to assess and rank fire risk levels for different areas within Christchurch.
4. Sensor Location Optimisation: Determine the optimal locations for installing early fire detection sensors based on the identified high-risk areas, considering factors such as accessibility, coverage, and cost-effectiveness.
5. User Interface: Create a user-friendly interface or dashboard for the city council to visualise the high-risk areas, and proposed sensor locations.
6. Data Privacy and Security: Ensure that there is authentication required at login meaning only those with specific rights can access the site.
8. Scalability and Maintainability: Design the system to be scalable and maintainable, allowing for the integration of additional data sources or the extension of the analysis to other regions in the future.
