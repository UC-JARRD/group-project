### **${{\color{red}\large{\textsf{TO DO NOW!!! Created 13.03.2024. Need to choose the service.}}}}\$**

### **Choose the web-service deployment**

Heroku, Railways, DigitalOcean, AWS, etc. 

Requirements: 

1. It should cover all the services which we need to make our start-up ðŸ™‚.
1. It should cost nothing for us ðŸ’².
1. It should have access to this working project for a long time without any participation, even after graduation.

Please make any suggestions to choose web-service deployment and explain why itâ€™s better or not.

Rubenâ€™s thoughts:

Guilio mentioned that he has AWS credits. We may be able to use them.

Render allows you to upload python code and run it. The backend is reasonably easy to use. Itâ€™s free. Scaling is hella expensive but would be out of scope of this project.

Google cloud is also an option. It has $300 of free credits. 

A few thoughts (Dimitrii) about the service:

1. Heroku provides build-in ready-to-use solutions with minimum coding and integration. It is a platform on top of the application server layer. The price is higher for UI and fast deployment.
1. Digital Ocean is a simple application server solution for small companies/start-ups. Has less functionality compared to Heroku/AWS/ Azure/etc. At the same time provides a good price.
1. AWS/Azure have developed infrastructure with multiple applications under the hood. Can easily integrate different solutions. At the same time costly and can be challenging for beginners.

I believe we can start with Digital Ocean first and develop an understanding of the processes on the server. We can move the infrastructure to another cloud platform if there is a need to do so. I donâ€™t think it will be necessary though considering the scope and the time of our project. DO is a trade-off between the complexity of bigger platforms like AWS and Azure where there are multiple services and the complexity of integration and PaaS as Heroku with simplified integration and dependence on their platform infrastructure. 

For now the simpler, the better:)

### **${{\color{red}\large{\textsf{IMPORTANT! Need to do! This is similar to the Data Contract that Guilio talked about in the lecture.}}}}\$**

We must apply this Data Contract to each part of the system as an input/output data format as we design them each individually.
Before developing the system we must define and coordinate (highlighted in red color in each part of the system) the inputs/outputs of every part of the system to avoid misunderstanding inside the system.



### **TO DO NOW!!! Created 13.03.2024 Done 18.03.2024**

As for team members to participate in specified parts of a project, it should be the **primary responsibility** of some parts and **the secondary responsibility** to help other team members. 

To solve tasks it suggested choosing the best (for you) two different parts to participate (just write a name near the green number of team members). Then we will agree together who will take some parts.

So, we should define the **primary role and secondary role of the task.** Your secondary role should be participation if somebody needs help from you if they have a lot of tasks. Any team member should participate and help others in a secondary role, which is defined as described above. For example, the most complicated part is the Application Server (a core of our system) as it seems. So, perhaps, after developing other parts of our system it should be ok if any team members help with the developing models.



### **TO DO NOW!!!** **Created 13.03.2024 Done 15.03.2024**

Everybody must create (or have) a GitHub account and put the link here. I will create a team in GitHub and add all members.


### **Comments**

Guilio also said that we should have:

- contributing.md document. This looks like a good example to copy: <https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/b24679402957c63ec426>
- A decision log / tracker. This looks like a good template: <https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/decision-record>
