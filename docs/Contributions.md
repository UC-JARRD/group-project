### **Description of team roles**

As for team members to participate in specified parts of a project, it should be the **primary responsibility** of some parts and **the secondary responsibility** to help other team members. 

To solve tasks it suggested choosing the best (for you) two different parts to participate (just write a name near the green number of team members). Then we will agree together who will take some parts.

So, we should define the **primary role and secondary role of the task.** Your secondary role should be participation if somebody needs help from you if they have a lot of tasks. Any team member should participate and help others in a secondary role, which is defined as described above. For example, the most complicated part is the Application Server (a core of our system) as it seems. So, perhaps, after developing other parts of our system it should be ok if any team members help with the developing models.
