- The TokenData model represents additional token data, such as the username associated with the token.
- The User model represents the structure of user data.
- The UserInDB model extends User and includes additional data stored in the database, such as the hashed password.
- Endpoints /users/me/ and /users/me/items require a valid authorization token in the request headers to access user-specific data.

Ensure to specify the database for user authentication and retrieval.
